# VQGAN + Latent Diffusion Image Generation

This repository contains the implementation of a VQGAN model combined with a latent diffusion model for generating high-quality, diverse images. The VQGAN model is used to encode images into a compressed latent representation, while the latent diffusion model generates new latent codes that can be decoded by the VQGAN to produce novel images.

## Overview

1. **VQGAN Model**: The VQGAN model is a variant of the traditional GAN architecture that uses vector quantization to learn a compressed representation of the input images. This compressed representation is known as the "codebook" or "dictionary" and allows for efficient generation and manipulation of images in the latent space.

2. **Latent Diffusion Model**: The latent diffusion model is a generative model that learns the distribution of the latent codes produced by the VQGAN. It can generate new latent codes that correspond to plausible images when decoded by the VQGAN.

By combining these two models, we can generate diverse and high-quality images by sampling from the latent diffusion model and decoding the generated latent codes using the VQGAN.
